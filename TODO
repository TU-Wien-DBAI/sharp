- add operator= implementation and copy-constructor to:
	* IterativeTreeSolver
	* TreeTupleAlgorithmAdapter

- add preprocessingOperations in IterativeTree(Tuple)Solver when libhtd supports it

- rename Extractor to Calculator, and inside: rename extractSolution to calculateSolution

- remove method "valid()" from Enumerator, replace by "ended" or something
	* also keep track of whether the Enumerator is *past* the end

- add more ways to instantiate an Enumerator
	* multiple iterators, not just one, to concatenate sets,
	  using e.g. http://www.drdobbs.com/common-knowledge-metaprogrammed-adapters/184401505

- move implementation of equal_to and less template specialization from headers into src (SHARP_API)
